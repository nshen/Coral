h1. This is a modified version of "Coral":http://github.com/richardlord/Coral

Here is the what I have done:

h3. Point3d :

I removied this class,becaust I think it is wasting time to convert between point and vector,and most library dont do that.

h3. Vector3d :

* add angleBetween() static method.
* add projectOnto() method.
* add scalarTripleProduct() method.
* incrementBy method add scale param.

h3. Matrix3d :

* rewrite newRotation and appendRotation method ,then when you rotate only the X or Y or Z axis will be quicker.
* add a result parameter to toMatrix3d() method.
* add a determinant33() getter method.
* add transformDirection() method.
* change position getter to getPosition(result) method.

h3. Quaternion :

* add slerp() method.


I just start to learn Math. If you know something I did is wrong please tell me ,thank you.
